# SCHOOL - Project

## DESCRIPTION  
The **MiniLibC** project involves re-implementing several functions from the standard C library (`libc`) using assembly language. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of low-level programming concepts and optimize specific routines.

---

## FUNCTIONS TO IMPLEMENT  
The project requires implementing the following functions:  
- `strlen`  
- `strchr`  
- `strncmp`  
- `memset`  
- `memcpy`  
- `memcmp`  
- Additional standard library functions as specified in the subject.

Each function must behave identically to its standard `libc` counterpart.

---

## FUNCTIONS ALLOWED  
- **System calls:** None.  
- **Other libraries:** None.  
- The use of external libraries or high-level abstractions is strictly prohibited.
